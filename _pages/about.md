I am Bhanu Pratyush Mantha, final year undergraduate pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NIT Trichy). My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Multi-Modality and 
Generative AI.


I have done my internship in CMU, [Xu Labs](https://xulabs.github.io/) where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Min Xu](https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/xu.html) on Self-Supervised Learning with Cryo-Electron Tomography in few-shot settings.
Prior to this I did my internship at [SLB](https://www.slb.com/), where I developed Segmentation models to seperate multiple curves from Raster Logs and a permutation invariant algorithm to join these segmented curves.
I have also done an internship in NIT Trichy, under the guidance of [Dr.S.Deivalakshmi](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/ece/faculty/deiva/)
where I worked on Image Super Resolution in medical domain.

I am also a Machine Learning Researcher at [Spider R&D](https://spider.nitt.edu/), the official Research and Development Club of NIT Trichy. Here I have worked on adapting [SAM](https://segment-anything.com/) to videos for the task of Camouflage Video Object Detection with addition of minimal parameters. 
I have also conducted a workshop on Diffusion Models and Text to Image using Stable Diffusion as a part of club.
