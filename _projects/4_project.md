This project won the **first place** at Schlumberger's (now SLB) New Year Hackathon among  1100+ teams from all across the nation.

It retrieves the latest energy feeds from different sites and gives a quick and concise summary of the articles using the BRIO abstractive summarizer. The website offers an interactive experience for the users with a fast response time. 
It is a very valuable resource for all energy-enthusiasts by providing articles and their summaries in a single page.
